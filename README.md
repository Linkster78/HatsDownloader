# About
This is a tool to fix the Hats mod by iChunUtil. The issue sometimes arises that no hats are loaded, the mod is simply unable to download them. With this tool, you can download the hats directly from the CDN and make a hats folder out of it.

## Usage
Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/RedstoneTek/HatsDownloader/releases) tab.

Put it on your desktop or other location of your choice. Open a command prompt/command line/shell and run the command `java -jar <jarname.jar>`.

Once it's done, there should be a complete `hats` folder generated, simply drag and drop it into your FTB server or your minecraft installation!
