# About
This is a tool to fix the Hats mod by iChunUtil. The issue sometimes arises that no hats are loaded, the mod is simply unable to download them. With this tool, you can download the hats directly from the CDN and make a hats folder out of it.

## Usage
Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/RedstoneTek/HatsDownloader/releases) tab.
